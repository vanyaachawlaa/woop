            <h2 class="beem">365 days of us</h2>
            <p class="beep">CAN YOU BELIEVE ITTT???I MEAN I CAN BUT CANT AT THE SAME TIME ITS SO SURREAL I knew from day 1 that this "us" would be beautiful and hell yeah it is its the most beautiful
               ive ever experienced. Every day we've grown, loved and learnt each other and im so grateful for you
               Your existence is enough to make me feel complete. You're truly a wonder yash tripathi.
               I can't believe i get to call you mine. I cant belive im yours. Its baffling how much you matter
               to me. 
               From a stranger to someone i wished to get to know to this rando i judged to my friend
               to my bestfriend now my favorite person and my sweetie patootie
               This has been quite a journey.
               I remember Radha asked me bohut pehle ki “Oye yeh kitna chalega first relationship hai girl”
               I said “Chalega” She asked me “3-4?months?” and i distinctly remember i said ki “Nahi 1 year pe btaugi”
               She was so confused ki i was confident ki 1 saal chal jayega but little does she know im confident that 1 saale se kaafi zyada hi chal jayega beacuse i know i love you and you have slowly become a part of my day, part of my life and a part of me.
               I vividly remember your goa trip and how we talked for ours lmfao and it felt so pure we both up at 3 am shit tired you on a literal trip and still wanting to not end your days without talking to me?
               “FRIENDS” YEAH.
               Want more of these “ friendship moments”
               LIKE THE PERIOD YOU WERE OFF SOCIALS AND THE MESSAGES AND THE PURE DESSPERATION IN OUR MESSAGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CLEAR SIGN LOL
               However much i hated those days at that time now i love them because they made me realise how much i loved you
               Distance makes the heart grow fonder fr
               AND OH DO YOU REMEMBER when babita maam told your parents ki we talk or blah blah and then we were like we cant talk school mei now and IT KILLED ME i felt so sad it was genuine sadness babey like oh god and then you gave me the taylor pin as a sorry/ remembrance thing and i carried that in my pencil box for weeks and woud look at it ever so fondly.
               LIKE HELLO?FRIENDS YEAHHHHHHHHH
               Denial mei the thankgod we got out of it
               Looks like we won the game right?</p>
